Hey, I am Ikhsan, Bima (a.k.a. _@k1r4). I am a CTF Player, Bug Hunter, Penetration Tester and Cyber Security Researcher.

Overall, My interest in Capture the Flag activities, Bug Bounty, and Finding Loopholes in System Security shows a strong interest in the world of cyber security and technology. These activities helped me develop important skills in protecting digital systems and infrastructure from potential threats, as well as providing opportunities to participate in an active and collaborative cybersecurity community..

Apart from that, I have also taken several courses at [Sekolah Hacker](https://sekolahdigitalcilsy.com/), [Pentester Labs](https://pentesterlab.com/profile/k1r44), and I'm also active in CTF on [Hackthebox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/394808).

I am currently studying S1 of Computer Engineering, Cybersecurity Vocational at [Amikom University](https://amikom.ac.id/)
